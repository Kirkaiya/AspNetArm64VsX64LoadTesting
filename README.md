# AspNetArm64VsX64LoadTesting
A repo for me and Jignesh to collaborate on our performance tests for Graviton3 vs latest Intel x64 with ASP.NET Core.

@JigneshSuthar - You can put the updated TechEmpower web app into a new folder inside src/ folder. I haven't tested the User Data scripts yet, but they should work (I will test soon).
